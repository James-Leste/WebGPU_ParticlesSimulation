# ParticlesSimulation Based on WebGPU

**POC**
The demo application is a prototype of particle simulation. Using the compute pipeline and rendering pipeline to simulate movement of particle. We implement interfaces that can change different movement rules of millions particles if proper mathematical models are applied. As you can see the application of webGPU can significantly increase the performance(frame rate) of process of calculation.
